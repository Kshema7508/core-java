1)   1. public static void main(String args[]):  It is a main method in java. It is use to call the code in runtime. public static  is a type of acces-modifier. voidis a return type. main is a method in java.

      2. class: It is a template or blueprint which consist of states and behaviour.  States are variables in class.  Behaviour are method in class.
          Object: Object is an instace of a class. It exists in a real time.

      3. JVM: JVM loads the bytecode, verifies the byte code and execute the byte code. Main purpose of JVM is  to provide runtime environment.
          JRE: JRE is a combination of JVM and set of libraries.  JRE=JVM+set of libraries. It is platform independent.
          JDK: JDK is a combinatio of JRE and java development tools(compiler, debugger). JDK=JRE+development tools.

2) public class ReverseNo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		int num[]= {1,2,3,4};
		
			for(int i=num.length;i>0;i--) {
				System.out.print(i);
				
			}
	}
}

3)class ReverseString{

	public static void main(String a[]){
		
		String name="program";
		char ch[]=name.toCharArray();
		for(int i=ch.length-1;i>=0;i--){
			System.out.print(ch[i]);
		}
		System.out.println( );
	}
}

4) Constructor: Construcor is a special type of method. Which has same name as class name without any returntype.
types of constructor: 1> Default constructor: Default constructor is without any parameter. 
			syntax: ClassName referencevariable=new Classname(); 
			eg: Hospital hospital=new Hospital();
		2> Paramiter constructor:the constructor having some parameter.
			syntacx: ClassName referencevariable=new Classname(parameter); 
			eg: Hospital hospital=new Hospital(patient);

5) this keyword: this keyword is used to invoke a   intance of variable.
eg:  public int Id;
        this.Id=Id;

7) Methods:Method is collection of statement or block of code. It is used to perfoem certain functionality.
Types of methods: 1. Pre-defined method : The method which is already defined by the progrming language.It is also called Buit-in-method. eg: max(), sqrt().
	               2. User-defined method: The method which is defined by the programmer or user is called user-defined method. eg: public static void multiply(int a){ ..}


9) class loading: class loading convert the source code to byte code.
Class loader: It is available in JVM. It loades the byte code in to JVM.

10) No. Because it is a intance of class. we cannot make class as private.

11)  class ArrayNo{

	static int num[]={12,3,2,45,6,7,6};

	public static void main(String a[]){

	 	System.out.println(num.length);
	 
	}
}

12) No
Because instance variables are accessed by object, but static variables are accessed by class.
